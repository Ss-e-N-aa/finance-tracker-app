- accessing an undefined route, i want the error to be displayed in the content area of the dashboard And without a whole page refresh 

- fetching the last transaction for expense and income : 
at first , bcus i was storing the date attribute as a string , i couldnt properly query the date and fetch the last item as firestore needs it
to be of type timestamp and not a string ... i tried storing the date as a timestamp , and then formatting it to a string ,
it worked , but then i got error of 'A non-serializable value was detected in the state' this is bcus  Firebase Timestamps (which include objects like { seconds: 1727552556, nanoseconds: 0 }) are non-serializable...

so , i have to format it back to a serializable format (like a string). 
i tried the toDate() but its still giving me non serializable error ... so , i used this code (from redux docs) to disable the errors : 
    middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
        getDefaultMiddleware({
            serializableCheck: false
        }), 

- i had a problem with fetching the last income/expense and displaying them both on the ui in Overview page .
i could only display the last transaction, be it expense or income , on the Card component. one Card was populated with the latest transaction,
and the other empty (null) ... after some messing around with chatgpt , i had to update the redux state after adding a transaction .
